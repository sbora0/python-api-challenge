Python API challenge assignment 6

For this assignment there were two requirements as given below:

1. For this task the requirement was to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator based on below details:
   
   •	Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude.

         o	Latitude vs. Temperature

         o	Latitude vs. Humidity

         o	Latitude vs. Cloudiness

         o	Latitude vs. Wind Speed


   •	Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship.

         o	Northern Hemisphere: Temperature (C) vs. Latitude

         o	Southern Hemisphere: Temperature (C) vs. Latitude

         o	Northern Hemisphere: Humidity (%) vs. Latitude

         o	Southern Hemisphere: Humidity (%) vs. Latitude

         o	Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude

         o	Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude

         o	Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude

         o	Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude



2. Create map using hvplot for below details:
    
         •	Create a map that displays a point for every city based on cities.csv data.

         •	Narrow down the data and then use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of city coordinates and show the information on a map. 

Files Information:

         •	CSV files "cities.csv" is in "WeatherPy\output_data" folder.

         •	Image files for scatter plots are in "WeatherPy\output_data" folder.

         •	Jupyter notebook file "WeatherPy.ipynb" and "VacationPy.ipynb" with the python script and output information is in "WeatherPy" folder.

         •	The plots and observation about the linear relationship is in the jupyter notebook "WeatherPy.ipynb" file.

         •	The hvplot for the cities is in “cities.png” in "WeatherPy\output_data" folder.

         •	The hvplot for the hotels is in “hotels.png” in "WeatherPy\output_data" folder.
