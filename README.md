Python API challenge assignment 6

For this assignment there were two requirements as given below:

1. For this task the requirement was to to visualise the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator based on below details:
    Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude.
    Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship.

2. Create map using hvplot for below details:
    Create a map that displays a point for every city based on a csv data.
    Narrow down the data and then use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 metres of city coordinates and show the information on a map 

Files Information:
CSV files "cities.csv" is in "WeatherPy\output_data" folder.
Image files for scatter plots are in "WeatherPy\output_data" folder.
Jupyter notebook file "WeatherPy.ipynb" and "VacationPy.ipynb" with the python script and output information is in "WeatherPy" folder.
The observation about the linear relationship is also in the jupyter notebook "WeatherPy.ipynb" file.
